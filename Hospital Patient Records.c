/*A health-monitoring startup stores step-count logs for every user.
Each user has a small note written by the AI coach, an array storing
 step counts for different time slots of the day,
and a dynamically allocated ID-code that the system generates during 
login.
The company wants a function that reads multiple users’ records, 
verifies whether any step count is abnormally low,
processes the coach-notes to remove extra spaces, and prints only 
those users whose generated ID-code length is valid.
Write a C program using functions + arrays + malloc/calloc + strings 
to perform all these checks.*/
